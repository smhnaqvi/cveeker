- **Tips section**: Provides guidance for better results
- **Manual edit option**: Allows users to edit resumes manually after AI generation

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

#### Dashboard (`src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`)
- Main interface component
- Handles state management for all form fields
- Integrates with AI service for API calls
- Provides real-time preview of generated resume

#### AI Service (`src/lib/services/ai.service.ts`)
- Handles all AI-related API calls
- Provides methods for generating and updating resumes
- Includes error handling and response formatting

### Backend Integration

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/ai/generate` - Generate new resume
- `POST /api/ai/update` - Update existing resume
- `GET /api/ai/status` - Check AI service status
- `POST /api/ai/users/:user_id/generate` - Generate for specific user
- `POST /api/ai/users/:user_id/resumes/:resume_id/update` - Update specific resume

#### Request Structure
```typescript
interface AIResumeRequest {
  prompt: string;
  user_id: number;
  resume_id?: number; // Optional for updates
  template?: string;
  theme?: string;
}
```

### State Management

The interface uses React state to manage:
- Selected industry/role
- Template and theme preferences
- Prompt text input
- Loading states
- Error messages

### User Flow

1. **User selects industry/role** from dropdown
2. **Template and theme** are automatically set (can be customized)
3. **Prompt suggestions** appear based on selected industry
4. **User enters custom prompt** or clicks on suggestions
5. **Validation** ensures all required fields are filled
6. **AI generation** creates/updates resume
7. **Real-time preview** shows the result
8. **User can edit manually** if needed

## Best Practices for Prompts

### Do's:
- Be specific about experience level and years
- Mention key technologies and tools
- Include certifications or specializations
- Specify focus areas or achievements
- Mention target companies or industries if relevant

### Don'ts:
- Use vague descriptions
- Forget to mention years of experience
- Leave out important technologies
- Use overly generic language

## Example Prompts by Industry

### Backend Developer
```
Create a backend developer resume with 5 years of experience in Node.js, Python, and PostgreSQL. 
Include experience with microservices architecture, RESTful APIs, and cloud platforms like AWS. 
Focus on database optimization and system scalability achievements.
```

### Frontend Developer
```
Generate a frontend developer resume with 3 years of experience in React, TypeScript, and modern CSS. 
Include experience with responsive design, accessibility standards, and state management with Redux. 
Highlight performance optimization and user experience improvements.
```

### DevOps Engineer
```
Create a DevOps engineer resume with 4 years of experience in Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines. 
Include experience with AWS, Terraform, and infrastructure automation. 
Focus on monitoring, logging, and security implementations.
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
1. **Advanced prompt templates** with more specific industry focus
2. **Multi-language support** for international users
3. **Prompt history** to save and reuse successful prompts
4. **A/B testing** for different prompt strategies
5. **Integration with job boards** for targeted resume optimization
6. **Real-time collaboration** for team resume building
7. **Advanced customization** options for templates and themes

### Technical Improvements:
1. **Caching** for frequently used prompts
2. **Offline support** for basic functionality
3. **Progressive Web App** features
4. **Advanced analytics** for prompt effectiveness
5. **Machine learning** for personalized suggestions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **AI Service Not Responding**
   - Check if OpenAI API key is configured
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check server logs for errors

2. **Poor Quality Results**
   - Ensure prompt is specific and detailed
   - Include relevant technologies and experience
   - Use industry-specific suggestions

3. **Template/Theme Not Applied**
   - Verify template and theme values are valid
   - Check if AI service supports the selected options
   - Ensure proper request formatting

### Error Messages:
- "User not authenticated" - User needs to log in
- "Please enter a prompt" - Prompt field is empty
- "Failed to generate resume" - AI service error
- "User not found" - Invalid user ID

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All AI requests require valid user authentication
2. **Authorization**: Users can only update their own resumes
3. **Input validation**: All prompts are validated before processing
4. **Rate limiting**: API calls are rate-limited to prevent abuse
5. **Data privacy**: User data is not stored in AI service logs

## Performance Optimization

1. **Lazy loading**: Components load only when needed
2. **Debounced input**: Prompt suggestions update efficiently
3. **Caching**: Frequently used data is cached
4. **Optimistic updates**: UI updates immediately for better UX
5. **Error boundaries**: Graceful error handling prevents crashes
